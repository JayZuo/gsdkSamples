# WindowsRunnerCSharp
Sample executable that integrates with PlayFab's Multiplayer Gameserver SDK (GSDK).

**Dependencies**
* PlayFab's Multiplayer Gameserver SDK (GSDK) - included.

**Prerequisites**
* Understanding of C#.
* Get [PlayFab's local debugging toolset](https://api.playfab.com/docs/tutorials/landing-tournaments/multiplayer-servers-2.0/debugging-playfab-multiplayer-platform-integration-locally).

**Overview**

This is a simple executable that integrates with PlayFab's Gameserver SDK (GSDK). It starts an http server that will respond to GET requests with a json file containing whatever configuration values it read from the GSDK.

**Features**
* Accepts GET requests and returns a json body with the GSDK configuration values.
* Sets up the PlayFab GSDK.

**Getting Started Guide**

To run this sample in Azure:
1. Build this solution as **Release|x64** and place all generated binaries in a zipped folder. Make sure the files are all at the root of the zipped folder (not in a subfolder).
2. Follow our [quickstart guide](https://api.playfab.com/docs/tutorials/landing-tournaments/multiplayer-servers-2.0/quickstart-for-multiplayer-servers), but instead of using the provided test server as an asset, use the zipped folder you created in step 1.
3. When you request a server, do a GET request to the ip and port provided in the response to the New-PFMultiplayerServer command, you should see a json body with details about the sample server.

To run this sample locally:
1. Setup [PlayFab's local debugging toolset](https://api.playfab.com/docs/tutorials/landing-tournaments/multiplayer-servers-2.0/debugging-playfab-multiplayer-platform-integration-locally), following the *Verifying GSDK integration* section.
2. Once the local agent is running, run the WindowsRunnerCSharp executable as administrator.
3. Open any browser, and navigate to http://localhost:3600, you should see a json body with details about the game server.

To remotely debug:
1. We used post-build event to add Remote Debugging tools and batch file as the Game Start command, you can edit port(4024 by default) and batch file name as you want.
2. Build this solution as **Debug|x64**.
3. Configure Build in GM normally, but in **Network** add an new **Port** "4024" with **Name** like "Debug" and **Protocol** to "TCP".
4. Upload assets as usual, but change the **Start game command** to your batch file like *C:\Assets\Start.bat*.
5. When you request a server, **Attach to Process** with **No Authentication** mode and set **Connection target** to the returned "IPV4Address" plus "Debug" port.

**Known Limitations**
* Currently, this sample will only work locally if you are also running the local agent. If you see a GSDK Exception on initialization, make sure the local agent is running.
* If you continue to see an issue repeatedly after starting the local agent or changing the MultiplayerSettings.json file, close the program (Visual Studio, Powershell,
* Command Prompt, etc.) you were using to run the WindowsRunnerCSharp executable or solution, start the local agent, reopen the program, and try running the 
* WindowsRunnerCSharp executable or solution again.
